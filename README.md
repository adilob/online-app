# online-app

## Start to work with this code

There is a docker-compose file to get the application up and running.
You can execute like this:

docker-compose up -d

After the docker compose builds and initilizes all containers you could open the Portainer.IO in the following address:
https://127.0.0.1/9443

The very first time you access the Portainer you'll need to create an admin password.
After that, you should only give your password next time.

Once you're logged in in the Portainer, navigate to the running containers so you can get custom to the contents of the application.

One last thing, you should execute the migrations for the two projects (web1 and web2) before start to use the application.
